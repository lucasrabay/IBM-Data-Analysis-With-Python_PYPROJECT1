# IBM Data Analysis With Python - Conclusion Project

Welcome to the IBM Data Analysis With Python Conclusion Project! This project serves as the final assignment for the IBM Data Analysis With Python Course. The primary goal of this project is to analyze data on houses in the Kings County Area and predict their prices using various data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to explore a dataset containing information about house sales in Kings County. The dataset includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and other attributes that could influence house prices. By employing data analysis and machine learning methodologies, we will seek to understand the patterns, correlations, and key drivers of house prices in the area.

## Key Features

1. **Data Analysis:** Utilize the powerful Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn to clean, preprocess, and explore the dataset. We will gain insights by visualizing data using Matplotlib and Plotly to understand the distribution of various features and relationships between them.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and normalize or scale data as required. Preprocessing the data is crucial for obtaining accurate predictions from our machine learning models.

3. **Machine Learning Models:** Employ machine learning algorithms from the Scikit-learn library to train and test predictive models. We will experiment with various regression techniques to predict house prices based on the features provided in the dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of our trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2).

5. **Visualization:** Visualize the predictions of our models to gain insights into how well they perform and identify any potential areas of improvement.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The project is developed using the Python programming language.
- Jupyter Notebook: Jupyter provides an interactive environment for data analysis and visualization.
- Libraries: We extensively use libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
